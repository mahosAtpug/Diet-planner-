                              3. Mix well to avoid any lumps. The batter should have a pouring consistency.
                              4. Heat the non - stick pan. Pour a laddle full of batter and spread in a circular motion (should be half the size of the tip of the index finger in thickness). Drixxle a little OIL.
                              5. Once it cooks from one side, lightly release from the pan and flip and cook on the other side untill it cooks through it should be golden brown in colour.
                              6. Once done form both the sides , serve hot with Green Chutney.
